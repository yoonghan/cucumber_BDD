To create Behavioural Driven Development.

# cucumber_BDD
This program has 2 samples:
1) Running Top down Cucumber-JVM test
2) Running Selenium with the Cucumber feature.

The program runs on JUnit with considerations.
1) JUnit can only execute classes that contains the keyword "TEST"
2) The test/resource folder exactly maps with the test/java folders when feature files is being read.
3) @CucumberOptions is something awesome as it shows additional info (e.g. time)
4) Learn gehkins to know more about Features/Stories(JBehave calls this as stories).
